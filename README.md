## Overview

### The challenge
The challenge is to build out this notifications page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

Users should be able to:

- Distinguish between "unread" and "read" notifications.
- Select "Mark all as read" to toggle the visual state of the unread notifications and set the number of unread messages to zero.
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size.
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page.
